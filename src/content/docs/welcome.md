# Hello World and Welcome!

Welcome to my digital garden! This is a space where I collect and cultivate ideas, notes, and resources on various topics.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas and notes that grow and change over time. Unlike a traditional blog with chronological posts, a digital garden is organized by topic and allows for continual updates and connections between ideas.

## How to Navigate

This garden is organized into several main sections:

- **[Programming](/topics/programming/index.html)**: Notes on coding, web development, and software engineering
- **[Design](/topics/design/index.html)**: Resources on UI/UX, visual design, and design systems
- **[Writing](/topics/writing/index.html)**: Thoughts on content creation, documentation, and storytelling

## Getting Started

To make the most of this garden:

1. Explore the sidebar to find topics that interest you
2. Click on links to navigate between related notes
3. Check back regularly as the garden grows with new content

Feel free to wander and discover something new!
